# Machine-Learning

This repository contains projects developed for the **Machine Learning** course.  
They demonstrate applied techniques across regression, classification, and real-time control using neural networks.

## Projects

### Autonomous Driving AI (`autonomous_driving/`)
Built and trained a convolutional neural network to control a vehicle in real-time using steering angle prediction.
- Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras
- Tools: Udacity simulator, OpenCV
- Output: `model.h5`, `drive.py`

### Applied ML Models (`ml1`)
Implemented and evaluated multiple ML models across different tasks:
- Polynomial Regression (2a)
- k-NN classification (2b)
- Naive Bayes text classification (3a)
- Decision trees (Titanic dataset)

> Each subproject contains its own Jupyter notebook and can be run independently.
