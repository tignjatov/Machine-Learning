# Machine-Learning

This repository contains projects developed for the **Machine Learning** course.  
They demonstrate applied techniques across regression, classification, and real-time control using neural networks.

## Projects

### Applied ML Models (`ml1`)
Implemented and evaluated multiple ML models across different tasks:
- Polynomial Regression (2a)
- k-NN Classification (2b)
- Naive Bayes Text Classification (3a)

**Datasets**  are stored on Google Drive → [Download here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1enfzL_zdd93MRgLr_EtquhGepKigbRgJ?usp=sharing)

### Autonomous Driving AI (`ml2`)
Designed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to autonomously drive a car in a real-time simulator. (3)
- Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras  
- Tools: Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator, OpenCV  
- Output: trained model (`model.h5`), `drive.py`  
And
- Decision Trees – trained a classifier on the Titanic dataset (`train.csv`, `test.csv`) to predict passenger survival  (1)
- Manual Neural Network – implemented a feed-forward neural network from scratch (matrix operations only) on the Titanic dataset (2)

> Each subproject contains its own Jupyter notebook and can be run independently.
